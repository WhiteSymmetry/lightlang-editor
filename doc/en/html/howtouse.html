<hr>
Consider two situations: 1 - if you have decided to create your dictionary, 2 if you have decided to edit already created dictionary. <br>
<b>1.</b>	Move of actions:
<ol>
	<li>Choose "File -> New" ( or Ctrl+N )</li>
	<li>Now you can add words: enter to main line a word, which you want to add, then enter translation and format it, how you want and press on the button "Add SL record" ( Ctrl+A )</li>
	<li>You can leave from the program and you records will store in database with name "untitled", but if you decide create one more dictionary, you'll have to save old under some name.</li>
	<li>To save dictionary, choose "File -> Save" ( Ctrl+S ) </li>
	<li>After it, you can replace or add created dictionary to database of dictionaries of LightLang - <a href ='interaction.html'>instruction</a></li>
</ol><br>
<b>2.</b> Move of actions:
<ol>
	<li>Choose "File -> Open" ( Ctrl+O ) and open a dictionary. If loaded dictionary is rather big, you'll have to wait some minutes. But you can check on progress, becouse of special progress bar.</li>
	<li>After it, as dictionary was loaded, you can edit and create new SL records. How to do it is discussing in point 2 of first situation. Editing some record is rather easy too: enter word in the main line or choose it from list of auto-search, edit translation and press on button "edit" ( Ctrl+E ).</li>
	<li>After editing all records will store in special database, <b>but</b> not in a file, that's why, to save dictionary in file, you should use point 4 from second situation.</li>
	<li>After saving you can load it to the service LightLang - <a href='interaction.html'>instruction</a>.</li>
</ol><br>
<center><h4>Other functions of the program</h4></center>

<b>Remove SL record</b> - if you enter existed word, you can remove it by using this button.<br>
<b>Zoom In/Zoom out</b> - if you see badly or letters is big for you, you'll be able to use these functions.<br>
<b>Bookmarks</b> - to don't enter some word, which you use very often, you can add it to bookmarks and by one click on this bookmark you move to editing this word.<br>
<b>Auto-search</b> - this function is very useful, if you don't know how some word is written or if you want watch all words, which is started with such substring, which you have entered. And you can else limit search, using filter. If you have too much words, you can sort them up or down.
